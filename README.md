This Automation was made for helping and guiding durring exploiting a stack overflow vulnerability, I have not created this original code big chunk of it
was inspired by the original creator https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ArlFuFYMpEewyRBzdLHiw (TheCyberMentor), I still working on it, I have tried to add some notes
besides some code lines to make it a little more unsderstandable. The way that the tools are msupposed to be used are from 1 to 3, 1 being the first tool that you
need to use.

Links that will be important to use during the exploitation:
